# Smart Carpark ML Codebase 🚗💡

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Smart Carpark system's ML codes! This code repository contains the detection models for the .

This is done as part of the Project for CS3237 - Introduction to Internet of Things, AY23/24 Semester 1.

Done by Group 5!

## Repository Structure 🗂️

Here's a guide to what you'll find in this repository:

- `extra/`: Contains all arduino sketch for ESP32 Camera necessary for operating the ESP32 Camera to capture image for car plate recognition and human detection functionalities.

- `final/`: Includes arduino sketch for ESP32 to manage and monitor parking lot statuses.

- `licensePlateDetector/`: Dedicated to the arduino sketch for ESP32 controlling the entry gate sensor logic and mechanisms.

- `peopleDetection/`: Houses the arduino sketch for ESP32 that manages the logic and mechanisms for the carpark's exit gate.

## Setup & Installation ⚙️

To set up your environment for contributing to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Python 3.10 installed on your computer.
2. Ensure you have MQTT server set up.
3. Install the ESP32 Board Manager in your Arduino IDE:
   - Go to `File > Preferences`.
   - In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, enter `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json` and click "OK".
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager...`.
   - In the search bar, type "esp32" and install the board that appears.
4. Install all necessary libraries as listed in the Dependencies section.
5. Connect your ESP32 / ESP32 Camera module and any other relevant hardware to your computer.

## Usage 🛠️

To use the code:

1. Navigate to the desired project folder.
2. Open the Arduino sketch (.ino file) with the Arduino IDE.
3. Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino module following the IDE's upload protocol.

## Dependencies 📚
